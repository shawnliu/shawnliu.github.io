<p>
  Zoom Zoom Drawing Club is for anyone who wants to draw with other people, over Zoom.
  It really is for anyone––you can be a beginner who needs a little bit of encouragement, or a seasoned artist who just wants some company, or someone in between who just wants to draw. All levels are welcomed!
</p>

<p>
  Each drawing club works like this: we gather, I'll share some optional reference photos
  (see examples below), and then we draw for half an hour quietly. After that there's a
  15-minute session for those who want to share their drawings.
  No critiques allowed, clapping is encouraged.

  Next session: <strong>Oct 9, <a href="https://everytimezone.com/s/ab6385e8">12pm EST</a></strong>.
