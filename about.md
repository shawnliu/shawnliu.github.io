<h1>About me</h1>

I, Shawn Liu, am an award-winning father of two boys, living in Brooklyn NY USA. Coffee is what I truly love (besides my family), and I try to convince myself <a href="https://doevery.day/mrshawnliu">every day</a> that I love drawing just as much.

MRSHAWNLIU authors a zine called <a href="https://www.patreon.com/MRSHAWNLIU">Neophyte</a>. He likes to listen to <a href="https://albumwhale.com/mrshawnliu/2022-favorites">music</a> while he draws.

For a couple hours a day, I also do some <a href="https://goodenough.us">stuff</a> on the internet. In my previous life, I founded a business (<a href="https://www.getharvest.com">Harvest</a>) and got real lucky with it (grateful, astonished, never take it for granted, etc).

Years ago my mother noticed that I like to take pictures of trash. She thought it was odd. I reminded her that I got my genes from her.

You can find me on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mrshawnliu/">Instagram</a>. Call me sir, or mister, especially if you're younger than 18, ok? Glad we understand each other.
