# October 9, 2024

Hello! Welcome to Zoom Zoom Drawing Club. As usual, feel free to draw whatever you want, however you please.

If youâ€™d like a drawing prompt or reference, I've found some pictures of puffins and baby puffins, known as <em>pufflings</em>. Last week, I listened to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/30/podcasts/animal-episode-2-puffins.html">fascinating podcast</a> about rescuing pufflings, and I've been thinking about them ever since. The podcast, titled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/animal-podcast"><em>Animal</em></a>, is hosted by Sam Anderson and produced by Kaitlin Roberts. I recommend it!
