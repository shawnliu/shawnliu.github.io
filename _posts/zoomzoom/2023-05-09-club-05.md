# May 10, 2023

Hello! Welcome to Zoom Zoom Drawing Club. As usual, feel free to draw whatever you want, however you please.

If you’d like some prompts, I’ve prepared some photos I snapped during a recent short trip to Tokyo.

Please join me on the **[Zoom Zoom Drawing Club forum](https://ponder.us/join/394ba2b9)**! 
One common feedback I've received is that people would like to
talk further after each drawing session, so
I've set up a private space for us to share work, ask questions, and discuss
drawing-related topics. Hope to see you there!

See you next time! 😄
