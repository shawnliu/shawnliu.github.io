    <li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/animal-podcast">Animal Podcast</a> is awesome, and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/30/podcasts/animal-episode-2-puffins.html">second episode</a> is about rescuing pufflings (you can see a video of Sam Anderson flinging a puffling off of a cliff!).</li>
    <li>And <a href="https://mrshawnliu.com/zoomzoom/2024/09/05/club-14.html">here</a> are some puffin reference photos from today's Zoom Zoom.</li>

      Say hello to <a href="https://albumwhale.com/">Album Whale</a>!
      The Whale, no relations to the new Brendan Fraser <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Whale_(2022_film)">movie</a>,
      is a little app that makes it easy to create pretty lists
      of albums, like <a href="https://albumwhale.com/mrshawnliu/2022-favorites">this</a> and
      <a href="https://albumwhale.com/pfiller/albums-that-take-me-to-a-specific-time-and-place">this</a>.
      It's nice and it's free, like all the best things in life.
      Sign up <a href="https://albumwhale.com/signup">here</a>.

      I really like this <a href="https://albumwhale.com/mrshawnliu/albums-with-big-faces">list</a>
      I made of albums with big faces.

      <a href="https://creativemornings.com/talks/upcoming?kind=fieldtrip">FieldTrips</a>
      are fun and free and virtual (meaning you can attend a workshop without leaving your home)!
      Consider hosting a workshop! Feel free to ask me if you have questions.

      For our drawing club yesterday I found many cool <a href="https://mrshawnliu.com/zoomzoom/2022-10-05">pictures and drawings of elephants</a>.
      <a href="https://www.artic.edu/artworks/21083/mechanical-elephant-with-festival-barge-and-korean-musicians">This</a> one's my favorite.

  <h2>Thu Mar 16, 2022</h2>
  <p>
    My friend Barry and I made a little thing called
    <a href="https://doevery.day">doevery.day</a>.
    I want a calendar to track my drawing each day,
    so that I can see the streak I'm building––and 
    have that as a motivation to keep going
    (so I don't break the chain). 
    As of today I'm on a 32-day streak!
  </p>
  <p>
    Just as important as the streak, 
    I want <a href="https://doevery.day/mrshawnliu">my calendar</a> to be public 
    so my friends can see my progress and encourage me.
    Or maybe just <em>knowing</em> that
    someone might see my doevery.day page pushes
    me forward?
  </p>
  <p>
    For those who don't care, here's an
    album recommendation: 
    <a href="https://heladonegro.bandcamp.com/album/far-in">Far In</a> by Helado Negro.
    And if that doesn't do it for you... perhaps 
    this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOsVpoe5tzY&t=34s">video</a> will?
